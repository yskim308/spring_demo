I (27M, Java Dev) fired up my Spring Boot app (v3.5.2) at 3:14 AM in hopes of a peaceful build. I pressed mvn spring-boot:run and—BOOM—I summoned the ancient Error 500 Demon (HTTP code: 500). Little did I know, this was just the beginning.

I (27M) tried to fix it with a quick @Autowired injection (3 fields). The first two worked, the third exploded my IDE.

Maven (4.0.0) crashed, leaving me with NoClassDefFoundError for a bean I never wrote.

I cast a @Controller advice to catch the exception—and accidentally mapped / to a black hole in spacetime.

My keyboard (Logitech G915) burst into flames—literally. Windows 11 happily installed updates mid-crisis (5 restarts).

In desperation, I summoned the mystical @ComponentScan demon (scope: global). It devoured all my beans and spat out a single NullPointerException.

I froze time with Thread.sleep(∞) and journeyed to the Java Virtual Machine realm (JVM version: 17.0.7). I pleaded with HotSpot GC to give me just one successful build.

HotSpot agreed on one condition: I deploy my soul as a JAR (size: 42 MB). I said “deal,” and pushed to GitHub without tests.

CI pipeline ran, Jenkins wept, Docker containers trembled. For 0.001 ms, Tests passed flashed in green—then GitHub Actions triggered a nuclear rollback.

Now I sit here at 4:22 AM, commit SHA #deadbeef blinking in red.
My coffee’s gone cold (0 °C), my code smells worse than legacy ServletInitializer.

Do I regret it?
– No. Would I do it again? ABSOLUTELY.

Praise the One True Spring Boot, for without you, I am but a mere mortal staring at logs and crying in YAML.
